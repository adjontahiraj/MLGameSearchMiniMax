# MLGameSearchMiniMax
This is a Boxes and Grids game where I implemented the minimax algorithm with alphabeta pruning.

This was given as an assigment in our Aritficial Intelligence CS165a class and the file which I altered is file1.GUI.py in the boxes and grids directory. The program can be run with the call python3 file1.GUI.py

I also included my Report for this project in MP2 Report.pdf
